# cba_f23_research

This repository has the files from the research work I conducted during Fall 2023 as part of the CBA lab. I worked on an exploration of the activity recognition chain (ARC) for sensor data, with particular focus on various feature extraction methods. 

The files:
- extraction3.ipynb has the first .ipynb file with complete ARC implementation for manual feature extraction including sliding window functionality and implmenting a random forest classifier.
- extraction4.ipynb has the complete ARC implementation for manual feature extraction which includes multiple classifers in addition to random forest.
- ECDF_TsFresh_implementation.ipynb has the ECDF and TSFresh library implementations for feature extraction.
